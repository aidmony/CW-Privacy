Construct streaming databases such that each $X_{i}$ owns a block of $cn$ rows by itself. In this figure, the middle block is always private. At each time step, $\frac  {1+c}{2} n$ rows need to be generated independently. We can connect $X_{t}$ back to $X_{1}$ to make the big database $X$ circular. Now, $X$ has size of $\frac  {1+c}{2} nt$}}{8}}
